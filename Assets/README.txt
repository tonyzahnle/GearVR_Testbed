This is my testbed for my Unity VR Projects.  I wanted to spend some time to hone my Unity skills and get something working and presentable for demonstration.




Ideas and things to implement:

AdManager class - For mobile projects, not VR

InControl input manager class - Integrate input/controller support for VR games

AchievementManager class - hold achievements/leaderboards in one place

AnalyticsManager class - hold all stat tracking/analytics in one place (Merge with achievements? Generic Event Manager that could fire off to tracking achievements too?  Something to think about...)

Expand GameManager to support multiple players?

Multiplayer networking (cross platform using CaptainsMess? Or own solution?)
